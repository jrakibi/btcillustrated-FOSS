## Setting Up

Configure your bitcoin-cli to connect to your full node. If you're new to this, there are plenty of online resources that can guide you through setting up and syncing a full node.
Usage example:

```sh
$ bitcoin-cli -rpcconnect=your_full_node_IP -rpcuser=your_username -rpcpassword=your_password getblockcount
823280
```

or you can add these lines to your `bitcoin.conf` file:

```
rpcconnect=your_full_node_IP
rpcuser=your_username
rpcpassword=your_password
```

Then you can execute `bitcoin-cli getblockcount` without extra options.

*HINT*: Use `bitcoin-cli help` and `bitcoin-cli help <command name>` to learn
  what commands are available and what they do.
