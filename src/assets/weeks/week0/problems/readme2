## What You Need to Do

To complete the exercise, you will need to answer each question with a bash script that utilizes `bitcoin-cli` commands. In addition to this, you might need bash operators (like for loops, if/else logic, etc.) and `jq` for parsing JSON, which you may need to install on your system.

Try to solve as many questions as you can. Some are easy, others are more challenging.
